# Phising url detection - A Machine Learning project

## Dataset :

This dataset has been found on kaggle, but was later removed to public.

Therefore, we decided to upload it again on this link :

## Models

To analyze and predict wheither an url is phishing or no, we tried to implement 2 types of models : 

- A KNN classifier
- A Neural Network classifier 

### KNN Classifier 

The KNN classifier has been implemented using the `KNeighborsClassifier` class of the `sklearn.neighbors` modules

### Neural Network classifier

The Neural Network classifier has been implemented using the `Sequential` class of the `tensorflow.keras` module
